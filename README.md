# Adidas_Sales_Analysis
### This project focuses on analysing Adidas sales for their various products

## Introduction
This project was done using Power BI. It provides insights into Adidas sales performance for their product. It includes data preparation, data modeling, DAX Calculations, interative reports and publishing on the web.

## Data Preparation
In this stage, I used a data cleaning tool in Power BI called Power Query to clean and structure the data correctly. The file is mostly clean so it needed minimal cleaning.
   - Removed the empty rows.
   - Promoted headers and changed the data type to the appropriate datatype.

## Data Modelling
In this stage, I used a star schema to optimize efficiency
   - created a calculated date table.
   - established relationship between the product, location, data and sales tables.

## DAX calculation

   - used the anchor, time intelligence and variance calculation
   - some key measures used in this report

## Report building
   - built 3 report pages. Trend analysis, deep insights and product.

## Publishing report on Power BI Service
    - report was pulished to power BI service
