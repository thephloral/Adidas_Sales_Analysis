# Adidas_Sales_Analysis
### This project focuses on analysing Adidas sales for their various products

## Introduction
This project was done using Power BI. It provides insights into Adidas's product sales performance. It includes data preparation, modeling, DAX Calculations, interactive reports and publishing on the web.

## Data Preparation
In this stage, I used a data cleaning tool in Power BI called Power Query to clean and structure the data correctly. The file is primarily clean, so minimal cleaning is needed.
   - Removed the empty rows.
   - Promoted headers and changed the data type to the appropriate datatype.

## Data Modelling
In this stage, I used a star schema to optimize efficiency
   - Created a calculated date table.
   - Established relationship between the product, location, data and sales tables.

## DAX calculation
I used the anchor, time intelligence, and variance calculation for this report. Some key measures used in this report are
   - Anchor: Total Sales, Total Profit, Transaction Count, Average Price, etc
   - Time Intelligence: Sales Year-to-Date, Profit Year-to-Date
   - Variance: Profit MOM, Sales MOM, etc

## Report building
   - Built three report pages.
     Trend analysis
     deep insights
     product

## Publishing report on Power BI Service
    - The report was published to the Power BI service
